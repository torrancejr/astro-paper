The phrases "spring forward" and "fall back" are mnemonic devices used to help people remember how to adjust their clocks during the start and end of Daylight Saving Time (DST). The idea is simple: in spring, you move your clocks forward by one hour (losing an hour), and in fall (autumn), you move your clocks back by one hour (gaining an hour). This practice is aimed at making better use of daylight during the evenings, and possibly saving energy.

The origin of Daylight Saving Time can be traced back to several proposals and implementations over the years, but it was widely adopted during the 20th century. One of the earliest advocates for a form of daylight saving was Benjamin Franklin, who, in a satirical letter in 1784, suggested that Parisians could save on candles by getting up earlier in the morning, making use of the natural morning light. However, Franklin's proposal was more of a jest and did not involve changing the clocks.

The first serious proposal for DST came from George Vernon Hudson, a New Zealand entomologist, in 1895. Hudson proposed a two-hour daylight-saving shift so he could have more daylight hours to collect insects in summer. However, this idea did not immediately catch on.

The first widespread implementation of DST occurred during World War I, when Germany and its allies adopted the time change on April 30, 1916, to conserve coal used for heating and electric power. The idea was that by shifting the clocks forward, people would use less artificial light in the evenings, thus saving energy for the war effort. Shortly thereafter, many other countries, including the United States and Britain, adopted similar measures.

After the war, many countries abandoned DST, only to readopt it during World War II for similar reasons. Following the end of the second war, the practice of observing DST became more varied and was determined by local jurisdictions in many countries. It wasn't until more standardized regulations were introduced in the late 20th century that DST became more uniformly observed, where it was adopted.

Despite its widespread use, DST has always been somewhat controversial, with debates about its actual benefits in terms of energy savings and its impacts on health, business, and daily life. Some regions and countries have chosen to stop observing DST, citing a lack of significant benefits or the desire to avoid the biannual clock changes.
