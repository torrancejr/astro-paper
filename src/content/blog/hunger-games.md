description: Which Hunger Games Movie is the best ?
---

This past weekend the wife and I perused the the tube for something awesome to watch. We came across the latest Hunger Games Movie. The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes [IMD Preview](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10545296/). It has been 15 years since the original Hunger Games book came out. I am old.

A heated convo ensued on which movie was the best. I said the original and she went with MockingJay Part 2. Hard Nope. We went to the internet to see what people thought. According to [RottenTomatoes](https://wwww.rottentomatoes.com) here is what the people believe.

5. The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes

Set 64 years before the events of the first film, its plot follows the events that lead a young Coriolanus Snow on the path to becoming the tyrannical leader of Panem, including his relationship with the Hunger Games District 12 tribute Lucy Gray Baird during the 10th Hunger Games. Rachel Zegler killed it. Her voice is amazing and I strongly disagree with this position

Haha. Thanks for reading.
